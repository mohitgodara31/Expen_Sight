## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
  * `npm` or `yarn`
  * The [ExpenSight Backend](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your-repo/expensight-backend) server must be running locally.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/expensight-frontend.git
    cd expensight-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project directory and add the following line. This tells the frontend where to find your backend API.

    ```env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## üìÅ Folder Structure

The project follows a standard feature-based folder structure to keep the code organized and scalable.

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/          # Axios configuration and interceptors
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/   # Reusable components (e.g., Modals, Layout)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contexts/     # React contexts (e.g., AuthContext)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/        # Top-level page components for each route
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/     # (Legacy, api/ is preferred)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.jsx       # Main application component with routing
```

## üåê API Integration

The frontend communicates with the ExpenSight backend via a configured Axios instance located at `src/services/api.js`. This instance automatically:

  * Uses the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` from your `.env` file.
  * Attaches the JWT authentication token from `localStorage` to the headers of all protected requests.
